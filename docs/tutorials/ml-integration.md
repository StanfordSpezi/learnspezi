# Machine Learning Integration

## Overview

This tutorial will teach you how to integrate machine learning capabilities into your Spezi application. You'll learn to build health data analysis, predictive modeling, and anomaly detection features.

**What you'll build:** An intelligent health application with ML-powered insights, predictions, and automated health monitoring.

**What you'll learn:**
- Core ML integration with Spezi
- Health data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Predictive modeling for health outcomes
- Anomaly detection and alerting
- Model deployment and management

## Prerequisites

- Completion of the [Template Application Setup](template-application-setup.md) tutorial
- Basic understanding of machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with Core ML and Create ML
- Knowledge of data science and statistics

## Coming Soon

This tutorial is currently under development. It will include:

- Complete ML integration guide
- Health data analysis workflows
- Predictive model development
- Real-time ML processing
- Model optimization and deployment

## What to Expect

The tutorial will cover:

1. **ML Framework Setup** - Configuring Spezi for machine learning
2. **Data Preprocessing** - Health data cleaning and feature engineering
3. **Model Development** - Building health prediction models
