## What is Spezi? ü§î

**Spezi** is an open-source Swift framework for rapid development of modern, interoperable digital health applications. Developed by Stanford's Biodesign Digital Health team, Spezi introduces a standards-based modular approach to building digital health applications with two primary building blocks:

- **Standards**: Coordinate data flow and define application-wide requirements
- **Modules**: Provide reusable, distinct functionality with inter-module communication
- **Swift-Native**: Built specifically for Swift with SwiftUI integration
- **Modular Architecture**: Components can be mixed, matched, and extended

### Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Standards & Modules** | Build with two core building blocks: Standards (coordinate data flow) and Modules (reusable functionality) |
| **SwiftUI Integration** | Native Swift framework with lifecycle management and SwiftUI observable mechanisms |
| **Inter-Module Communication** | Modules can enforce requirements, define dependencies, and share information |
| **Constraint Mechanisms** | Built-in validation and requirement enforcement across modules |
| **Onboarding & Account Management** | Pre-built modules for user registration, consent, and account handling |
| **Device Connectivity** | Bluetooth and device pairing modules for health sensors and wearables |
| **Questionnaires & Validation** | Structured data collection with built-in validation capabilities |
| **Local LLM Support** | Privacy-preserving AI integration with local language model modules |

### Why Choose Spezi?

- **Rapid Development**: Get from idea to prototype in days, not months
- **Standards Compliance**: Built-in support for healthcare standards
- **Active Community**: Join a growing community of developers and researchers
