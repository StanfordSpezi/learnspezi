## What is Spezi? 🤔

**Spezi** is an open-source Swift framework for rapid development of modern, interoperable digital health applications. Developed by Stanford's Biodesign Digital Health team, Spezi introduces a standards-based modular approach to building digital health applications with two primary building blocks:

- **Standards**: Coordinate data flow and define application-wide requirements
- **Modules**: Provide reusable, distinct functionality with inter-module communication
- **Modular Architecture**: Components can be mixed, matched, and extended
